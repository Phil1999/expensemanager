# Expenses App

## **Motivation**
I wanted to create a site where you can manage your expenses and see aggregated data about your expenses. There is also a income section where you can do the same operations as expenses.

## **Description**
Website where users can login and immediately start logging their expenses/income and view visualizations of them. 

## **Technologies Used**

- Javascript

## **Features**
